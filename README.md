# Problem Statement:

Our task is to create a tool using Streamlit for evaluating the quality of the Freddie Mac single-family dataset and checking if it matches the specified schema. Users will upload CSV or Excel files and indicate whether it contains origination or monthly performance data. We will use Pandas Profiling to summarize the data for users. Additionally, Great Expectations will be employed to ensure that the data adheres to the correct schema, if it is valid, contains no missing data, and passes other necessary tests. The project's architecture will also be visualized and embedded using diagrams within the Streamlit application.
